Edge-Detector
========================================
This project mainly aims to detect the edge of `flower.JPG`. But you could also try other images.<br>
Because the `MethodMyself2` has many loop, it might take a while to show the result.<br><br>

please check Result.png or run `Main.m` to see the results.<br>

Here is the result below:
![image](./Result.png "kernel")
